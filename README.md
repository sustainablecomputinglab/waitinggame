# Code Repository for paper submission

In this repository, we host the code for our SC paper submission. The repository consists of implementation for following contributions (sections)

* Model Analyzer
* Synthetic Trace Generator
* Simulator

To run code implementation for each of these sections (along with **synthetic_traces** folder), please check readme file in their respective folders.

## Requirements

1. Python3.6

2. Python libraries from attachment requirement.txt file.

## Data

1. Synthetic traces (hdf format) used for experiments are provided in the **synthetic_traces** folder.

2. Real World Trace (hdf format): https://umass.box.com/s/53qbzafs27wu28jh165twykqegwerud3

3. In this work, we use pandas to read the data sets (or traces) and the pandas dataframes are used as input to the implemented simulator.
